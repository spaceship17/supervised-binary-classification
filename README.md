## Here's the possible supervised binary classification problems.
Project Title: Supervised Binary Classification Explorations

Overview

This repository explores solutions to supervised binary classification problems using a variety of established machine learning methods.

Methods Implemented

1.Decision Tree: Constructs a tree-like model of decisions to predict class labels.
2.Random Forest: Builds an ensemble of decision trees for robust classification.
3.SVM/kernel SVM: Finds a hyperplane for optimal separation between classes, with optional kernel functions for non-linear problems.
4.KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): Classifies based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest data points.
5.Na√Øve Bayes: Probabilistic classifier applying Bayes' theorem with an assumption of feature independence.
6.Logistic Regression: Linear model using a logistic function to predict class probabilities.
